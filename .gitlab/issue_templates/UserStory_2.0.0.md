## Pre-checklist

- [ ] I have searched for, and did not find, an existing issue at the [top-level](https://gitlab.com/LibreFoodPantry).


## Stories

<!--
See https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories

Typically only one story is necessary.
If more roles want the same feature for different reasons,
then consider more than one story.
-->

Story 1: As a [role] I want [feature] so that [benefit].

Story 2: As a [role] I want [feature] so that [benefit].


## Ready checklist

<!--
This section is used to determine if a story is ready to be worked on by a team.
See https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/
-->

- [ ] Independent (of other issues in flow)
- [ ] Negotiable (and negotiated)
- [ ] Valuable (the value to an identified role has been identified)
- [ ] Estimable (the size of this story has been estimated using `/weight value` or the menu on the right)
- [ ] Small (can be completed in 50% or less of a single iteration)
- [ ] Testable (has testable acceptance criteria)

Also

- [ ] Appropriate role labels have been applied (e.g., `role:*`).
- [ ] Relevant activity labels have been applied (e.g., `activity:*`).
- [ ] Linked to related issues, epics, and milestones.

<!--
The real point of estimates is to shake out assumptions.
Estimates are made in story points using a Fibonacci scale.
Story point estimates are relative. That is, a team estimates a story
relative to other stories; other stories they have completed or
other stories in the backlog.

## Diagrams

<!--
Include screenshots, mock-ups,
design diagrams and any other images that help define the activity.
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Use Gherkin syntax (https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).
-->

```
Scenario: [3-5 word description of scenario]
  Given [Provide initial context for the scenario]
  When [Describe an event or action]
  Then [Describe the expected outcome or result]
```
